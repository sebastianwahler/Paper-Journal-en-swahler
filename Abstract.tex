Social ties are essential inputs for the detection of criminal gangs. This input becomes even more important when it can be analysed and visualized using software tools. This paper presents a software development, currently in use, for the analysis and visualization of social networks created from criminal records in the province of Chubut. The identification of illegal networks, such as criminal gangs, is of special interest in order to promote intelligent criminal prosecution.

%A study of the current techniques and methodologies of intelligent data analysis and visualization for assistance in criminal investigation is presented, based on the records of criminal activities, their authors and the data relationships that can be derived from them. As a corollary of the investigation, the development of a software module for visualization is shown. The identification of illegal networks, such as criminal gangs, is of special interest in order to promote intelligent criminal prosecution.
